# Project Title

Token Creation for ETH Proof Beginner Course

## Description

First, the program has a contract with public variables storing the details about coins, which have variables such as Token Name and Token Abbrv. and Token Supply.

After that, we are mapping addresses to unsigned integers.

Then there are two functions mint and burn.
Mint function has two parameters address and value . Mint function increases the total supply by the number and then it increases the sender's balance by a similar amount.

Burn function is opposite to Mint function, Burn function decreases the total supply by the number and then decreases the sender's ;  balance by a similar amount.
It should follow the condition that balance of sender should be greater than the amount that is burned.
